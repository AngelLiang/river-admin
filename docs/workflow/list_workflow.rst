List Workflows
==============

``Home`` page of ``River Admin`` is also listing workflow page.
If you are home for the first time meaning that you haven't had
any workflow before, this page won't have any workflow to list.
But once you have your first workflow you will start seeing them.


|Workflow List Img|

If your user is authorized to do those operations, the component
comes with bunch of button that allows you to go to a workflow's
``detail``, ``editing the workflow``, ``authorization rule management``
pages and a button to delete it.

.. rst-class:: center
|Go to View Workflow|
|Go To Edit Workflow|
|Go To Workflow Authorizations|
|Delete Workflow|


.. note::
    Those buttons for the workflow will be disabled if you don't
    have the required permissions.
